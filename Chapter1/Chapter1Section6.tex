\textbf{\underline{\large{1.6: Local Linearity, Euler's Method, and Approximations}}} \par

Before calculators, one of the most valuable uses of the derivative was to find approximate function values from a tangent line. Since the tangent line only shares one point on the function, $y$ values on the line are very close to $y$ values on the function. This idea is called local linearityâ€”near the point of tangency, the function curve appears to be a line. This can be easily demonstrated with the graphing calculator by zooming in on the point of tangency. \par 

Consider the graphs of $y = \dfrac{1}{4}x^4$ and its tangent line at $x = 1$, given by the equation $y = x - \dfrac{3}{4}$: \par

\end{center}

The closer you zoom in, the more the line and the curve become one. The $y$ values on the line are good approximations of the $y$ values on the curve. For a good animation of this concept, see the following: \begin{align*}
    \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lVYbRbXydqBz8KJWOfwWGO_c_oe58bC6/view?usp=sharing}{\text{\textcolor{blue}{tangent line approximation animation}}}
\end{align*} 

Since it's easier to find the $y$ value of a line arithmetically than for other functions --- especially transcendental functions --- the tangent line approximation is useful if you have no calculator. \par

    Use the Equation of a Tangent Line to Approximate Function Values.
\end{tcolorbox} \vspace{11pt}

\begin{tcolorbox}[example]
    \textbf{Ex 1.6.1: } Find the equations of the line tangent to $f(x) = x^4 - x^3 - 2x^2 + 1$ at $x = -1$. 
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[solution]
    \textbf{Sol 1.6.1: } The slope of the tangent line will be $f'(-1)$ \begin{align*}
        & f'(x) = 4x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x \\[11pt]
        & f'(-1) = 4(-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 - 4(-1) = -3 
    \end{align*} 
    (Note that we could've gotten this more easily with the nDeriv function on our calculator.) \begin{align*}
        & f(-1) = 1, \; \therefore \boxed{y - 1 = -3(x + 1)} \text{ or } \boxed{y = -3x - 2} 
    \end{align*} 
\end{tcolorbox}

One of the many uses of the tangent line is based on the idea of local linearity. This means that in small areas, algebraic curves act like lines --- namely their tangent lines. Therefore, one can get an approximate $y$ value for points near the point of tangency by plugging $x$ values into the equation of the tangent line. \par

\begin{tcolorbox}[example]
    \textbf{Ex 1.6.2: } Use the tangent line equation found in \textbf{Ex 1.6.1} to get an approximate value of $f(-0.9)$. 
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[solution]
    \textbf{Sol 1.6.2: } While we can find the exact value of $f(-0.9)$ with a calculator, we can get a quick approximation from the tangent line. \\[11pt]
    If $x = -0.9$ on the tangent line, then: \begin{align*}
        & f(-0.9) \approx y(-0.9) = -3(-0.9) - 2 = \boxed{0.7}
    \end{align*}
\end{tcolorbox}

This last example was somewhat trite in that we could've just plugged $-0.9$ into $f(x) = x^4 - x^3 - 2x^2 + 1$ and figured out the exact value even without a calculator. It would have been a pain, but it is doable. Consider the next example, though. \par

\begin{tcolorbox}[example] 
    \textbf{Ex 1.6.3: } Find the tangent line equation to $f(x) = e^{2x}$ at $x = 0$ and use it to approximate the value of $e^{0.2}$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[solution]
    \textbf{Sol 1.6.3: } Without a calculator, we could not find the exact value of $e^{0.2}$. In fact, even the calculator gives us an approximate value. \begin{align*}
        & f'(x) = 2e^{2x} \text{ and } f'(0) = 2e^{2(0)} = 2 \\[11pt]
        & f(0) = e^0 = 1 
    \end{align*} 
    So the tangent line equation is $\boxed{y - 1 = 2(x - 0)}$ or $y = \boxed{2x + 1}$ \begin{align*}
        e^{0.2} \approx 2(0.2)+ 1 = \boxed{1.2}
    \end{align*}
    Note that the value you get from a calculator of $e^{0.2}$ is $1.221403 \dots$. Our approximation of $1.2$ seems very reasonable.
\end{tcolorbox}

Though not as useful as practically useful (in 2 dimensions) as the tangent line, another context for the derivative is finding the equation of the normal line. \par

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
    \textit{Normal Line} $\rightarrow$ Definition: The line perpendicular to a curve.
\end{tcolorbox} \vspace{11pt}

\begin{tcolorbox}[example]
    \textbf{Ex 1.6.4: } Find the equation of the line normal to $f(x) = x^4 - x^3 - 2x^2 + 1$ at $x = -1$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[solution]
    \textbf{Sol 1.6.4: } In \textbf{Ex 1.6.1}, we saw that the slope of the tangent line was $f'(-1) = -3$. The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line and, therefore, has the negative reciprocal slope of $\dfrac{1}{3} \forcespace$. This gives us \begin{align*}
        & \boxed{y - 1 = \dfrac{1}{3}(x + 1)} \text{ or } \boxed{y = \dfrac{1}{3}x - \dfrac{4}{3}}
    \end{align*} for the equation of the normal line.

\textbf{\large{Euler's Method}} \par

\begin{tcolorbox}[objective]
    \begin{center}
        OBJECTIVES \\[11pt]
    \end{center}
    Use Euler's Method to Approximate a Numerical Solution to a Differential
    Equation at a Given Point. 
\end{tcolorbox}

In the previous section, we learned a little regarding approximations with tangent lines. Euler's Method is just a better approximation method. It uses more than one tangent line to get the job done. \par

The process is similar to approximating with tangent lines. We use $\deriv \forcespace$ to find a tangent line, then use that tangent line to find an approximate value for $y$. We then use that $y$ value and another $x$ value to create another "tangent line." Of course, it isn't actually a tangent line because our $y$ value wasn't actually on the curve. We then repeat the process until we get to the value we want to approximate. \par

\textbf{Steps to Euler's Method}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify your starting point and step size.
    \item Use $\deriv$ to find the slope and make it a tangent line. 
    \item Find an approximate $y$ value by plugging in $x + (\textit{1 step size})$ to the tangent line.
    \item Use the approximate $y$ value and the next $x$ step over to make a new tangent line.
    \item Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you reach your final $x$ value -- the one you actually want an approximation for.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[example]
    \textbf{Ex 1.6.5: } Use Euler's Method with a step size of $\dfrac{1}{2}$ to estimate $f(3)$, where $f(x) = \ln (x)$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[solution]
    \textbf{Sol 1.6.5: } \begin{align*}
        & f(1) = \ln 1 = 0 && \text{We start with 1 because we know } \ln 1 = 0. \\[11pt]
        & f'(x) = \dfrac{1}{x} && \text{We start by taking the derivative.}
    \end{align*}
    Note that in our chart below, we are getting our "New $y$" from our tangent line (step 3 above). Our "New $x$" comes from the "$x + (\textit{1 step size})$" step. Our new slope comes from plugging in the "New $x$" into $f'(x)$. For instance, for our first step below, the "New $x$" is equal to 1 plus the step size of $\dfrac{1}{2} \smallforcespace$ given in the problem, our "New $y$" comes from plugging in $\dfrac{3}{2}$ for $x$ and solving for $y$ in $y - 0 = 1(x - 1)$, and our slope (for the next step) is a result of $f'\left(\dfrac{3}{2}\right) = \dfrac{1}{\frac{3}{2}} = \dfrac{2}{3}$. \\
    \begin{align*} 
        \def\arraystretch{2.2} 
        \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline 
            \textbf{Step} & \textbf{Point} & f'(x) \textbf{ (Slope)} & \textbf{Tangent Line Equation} & \textbf{New } x & \textbf{New } y \\[5.5pt] \hline
            1 & (\textcolor{Red}{1}, \textcolor{blue}{0}) & \textcolor{Green}{1} & y - \textcolor{blue}{0} = \textcolor{Green}{1}(x - \textcolor{Red}{1}) & \textcolor{Red}{\dfrac{3}{2}} & \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{1}{2}} \\[5.5pt] \hline
            2 & \left(\textcolor{Red}{\dfrac{3}{2}}, \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{1}{2}}\right) & \textcolor{Green}{\dfrac{2}{3}} & y - \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{1}{2}} = \textcolor{Green}{\dfrac{2}{3}}\left(x - \textcolor{Red}{\dfrac{3}{2}}\right) & \textcolor{Red}{2} & \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{5}{6}} \\[5.5pt] \hline
            3 & \left(\textcolor{Red}{2}, \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{5}{6}}\right) & \textcolor{Green}{\dfrac{1}{2}} & y - \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{5}{6}} = \textcolor{Green}{\dfrac{1}{2}}\left(x - \textcolor{Red}{2}\right) & \textcolor{Red}{\dfrac{5}{2}} & \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{13}{12}} \\[5.5pt] \hline
            4 & \left(\textcolor{Red}{\dfrac{5}{2}}, \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{13}{12}}\right) & \textcolor{Green}{\dfrac{2}{5}} & y - \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{13}{12}} = \textcolor{Green}{\dfrac{2}{5}}\left(x - \textcolor{Red}{\dfrac{5}{2}}\right) & \textcolor{Red}{3} & \textcolor{blue}{\dfrac{77}{60}} \\[5.5pt]
            \hline
        \end{array}
    \end{align*}

    So, $f(3) \approx y(3) = \boxed{\dfrac{77}{60}} \text{ or } \boxed{1.28\overline{3}}$. By way of comparison, $\ln 3 \approx 1.099$. 
\end{tcolorbox}

If we had just used the initial tangent line (the tangent line from step one) to get an approximation, we would've gotten $f(3) \approx 2$. Euler's method got us a much closer approximation. \par

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\graphicsdir Chapter 1 Graphics/1.6-Graphic3.png}

We could also use this process to approximate a value for a curve when we only
know its derivative and an initial value on the curve. \par

\begin{tcolorbox}[example]
    \textbf{Ex 1.6.6: } Use Euler's method with a step size of $\dfrac{1}{2}$ to estimate $f\left(\dfrac{5}{2}\right)$ for the function whose derivative is given by $\deriv = 2x + y$ with an initial value of $f(1) = 4$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[solution]
    \textbf{Sol 1.6.6: } For this problem, to find the slope for each step, we simply we need to plug in our point into the given differential equation. \begin{align*}
        \def\arraystretch{2.2} 
        \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Step} & \textbf{Point} & \deriv \textbf{ (Slope)} & \textbf{Tangent Line Equation} & \textbf{New } x & \textbf{New } y \\[5.5pt] \hline
            1 & (1, 4) & 6 & y - 4 = 6(x - 1) & \dfrac{3}{2} & 7 \\[5.5pt] \hline
            2 & \left(\dfrac{3}{2}, 7\right) & 10 & y - 7 = 10\left(x - \dfrac{3}{2}\right) & 2 & 12 \\[5.5pt] \hline
            3 & (2, 12) & 16 & y - 12 = 16(x - 2) & \dfrac{5}{2} & 20 \\[5.5pt]
            \hline
        \end{array}
    \end{align*}
    $f\left(\dfrac{5}{2}\right) \approx y\left(\dfrac{5}{2}\right) = \boxed{20} \forcespace$. We cannot get an exact value for this function, because we have not learned techniques regarding how to solve this differential equation yet.
\end{tcolorbox} \vspace{11pt}

\begin{tcolorbox}[example]
    \textbf{Ex 1.6.7: } Is the approximation in \textbf{Ex 1.6.6} an overestimate or underestimate? Why?
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[solution]
    \textbf{Sol 1.6.7: } To determine this, we need to look at the concavity of the curve -- this requires the second derivative. \begin{align*}
        & \deriv = 2x + y \\[11pt]
        & \deriv[2] = 2 + \deriv && \text{Don't forget implicit differentiation!} \\[11pt]
        & \deriv[2] = 2 + (2x + y) \\[11pt]
        & \deriv[2] \eval_{(1, 4)} = 2 + 2(1) + 4 = 8 && \text{Plug in our initial value}
    \end{align*}
    Since the second derivative is positive, our curve is concave up at this point, which means our tangent line lies under the curve. This is indicative of an $\boxed{\text{underestimate}} \smallforcespace$.
\end{tcolorbox}

Generally: \par

\begin{center}
    \fbox{\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.96 \textwidth}
        \begin{tabbing}
            $\rightarrow$ \= Your approximation will be an \textbf{overestimate} if the curve is \textbf{concave down} (since \\

        \end{tabbing}
    \end{minipage}}}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[example]
    \textbf{Ex 1.6.8: } Use Euler's method with four equal step sizes to approximate $f(2)$ for $\deriv = 3y - x$, given $f(0) = 1$. Is this an overestimate or an underestimate?
\end{tcolorbox} 
\begin{tcolorbox}[solution]
    \textbf{Sol 1.6.8: } First, let's figure out our step sizes. We know that we start with $x = 0$, and we need to end up at $x = 2$. Therefore, four equal step sizes means that each step must be $+\dfrac{1}{2} \forcespace$. \par
    Next, let's make our table: \begin{align*}
        \def\arraystretch{2.2} 
        \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Step} & \textbf{Point} & \deriv \textbf{ (Slope)} & \textbf{Tangent Line Equation} & \textbf{New } x & \textbf{New } y \\[5.5pt] \hline
            1 & (0, 1) & 3 & y - 1 = 3(x - 0) & \dfrac{1}{2} & \dfrac{5}{2} \\[5.5pt] \hline
            2 & \left(\dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{5}{2}\right) & 7 & y - \dfrac{5}{2} = 7\left(x - \dfrac{1}{2}\right) & 1 & 6 \\[5.5pt] \hline
            3 & (1, 6) & 17 & y - 6 = 17(x - 1) & \dfrac{3}{2} & \dfrac{29}{2} \\[5.5pt] \hline
            4 & \left(\dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{29}{2}\right) & 42 & y - \dfrac{29}{2} = 42\left(x - \dfrac{3}{2}\right) & 2 & \dfrac{71}{2} \\[5.5pt]
            \hline
        \end{array}
    \end{align*}
    We can see that $f(2) \approx y(2) = \boxed{\dfrac{71}{2}} \forcespace$. Now, let's solve for the second derivative to find out if this is an overestimate or underestimate. \begin{align*}
        & \deriv[2] = 3\deriv - 1 = 9y - 3x - 1 \\[11pt]
        & \deriv[2] \eval_{(0, 1)} = 9(1) - 3(0) - 1 = 8
    \end{align*}
    Because the positive second derivative indicates that $y$ is concave up at $(0, 1)$, our Euler's Method result is going to be an $\boxed{\text{underestimate}} \smallforcespace$.
\end{tcolorbox}
