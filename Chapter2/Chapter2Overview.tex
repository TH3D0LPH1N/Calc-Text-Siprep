\textbf{\underline{\large{Chapter 2 Overview: Anti-Derivatives}}} \par

As noted in the introduction, Calculus is essentially comprised of four operations: \begin{itemize}
    \item Limits
    \item Derivatives
    \item Indefinite Integrals (Or Anti-derivatives)
    \item Definite Integrals
\end{itemize}

As mentioned above, there are two types of integrals
